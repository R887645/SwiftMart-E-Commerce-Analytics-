# Introduction
As part of the SabiCAMP **2025** Data Analytics track, I undertook a simulated project analyzing SwiftMart, a fast-growing online retailer. 
The company had been collecting large volumes of sales, customer, and website traffic data, but struggled to extract actionable insights. My role was to act as the lead Data Analyst, responsible for cleaning, modeling, and visualizing the data to uncover trends and provide recommendations. 
This project allowed me to apply end-to-end analytics skills — from data preparation to dashboard design — using Power BI as the primary tool.

# Business Challenge
SwiftMart was data-rich but insight-poor. Management lacked clarity on key performance drivers and needed answers to critical questions:

- Which products and regions generate the most revenue?

- Who are repeat customers and how do they behave?

- Which marketing channels convert best, and where are sales being lost?

- How can operational inefficiencies be identified and addressed?

The challenge was to transform raw, fragmented data into structured insights that could guide executive decision-making and improve overall business performance.

# Data Overview & Preparation
**Datasets Used:**

- **Sales & Transactions:** Revenue, quantity, product, date, region

- **Customers:** Customer ID, gender, purchase frequency, status
